# student-performance-dashboard
An end-to-end data analytics project analysing student performance data. Includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and an interactive Tableau dashboard.

This project explores student performance data to analyze how factors such as parental education level, test preparation, and gender affect math, reading, and writing scores using:
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Tableau
- Google Colab
- gitHub

Results - After analysis, 3 conclusions can be made from the data: Students whose parents have college degrees averaged higher scores, Students who completed the test preparation course averaged 7.6 points higher than those who did not across subjects, and Female Students greatly outperform male students in reading and writing score performance, while male students average higher in Math.
